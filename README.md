### What Problem Does It Address?

The K-means algorithm tackles the problem of partitioning a dataset into *k* clusters based on the features of the data. Its goal is to minimize intra-cluster variance (ensuring that data within the same cluster are as similar as possible) while maximizing inter-cluster variance (making data in different clusters as distinct as possible).

### Objectives

**Main Objective:**  
- Develop an implementation of the K-means algorithm that approaches the performance of existing solutions.

**Intermediate Objectives:**  
- **Study and Analysis:**  
  Understand how the K-means algorithm works and analyze existing implementations to identify key factors behind their efficiency.
- **Design:**  
  Define the specifications for our implementation, including the selection of an appropriate centroid initialization method.
- **Development:**  
  Create a first version of the algorithm by coding it from scratch, integrating the chosen initialization method, and ensuring basic functionalities are met.
- **Optimization:**  
  Identify opportunities for improvement through testing and optimize the code to enhance performance.

**Additional Objectives:**  
- After achieving performance on par with standard implementations, explore and implement advanced variants of the K-means algorithm along with further optimizations to improve accuracy, efficiency, and robustness.

### Testability

The project’s testability will be demonstrated through performance comparisons using standard datasets. By evaluating clustering results, we will compare our implementation against existing versions to ensure quality and performance.

### Why It’s Not Just an API Collage

Our project goes beyond simply using off-the-shelf APIs for several reasons:
- **Deep Understanding:**  
  We are building the algorithm from scratch, which requires a thorough grasp of its internal workings.
- **Customization:**  
  Our approach allows us to modify and optimize the algorithm according to our specific needs, a flexibility that is not possible with a pre-built API.

In summary, this project aims to deepen our understanding of the K-means algorithm, explore various optimization avenues, and develop strong programming and data analysis skills—all by crafting a custom implementation from the ground up.
